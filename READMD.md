## Vacation Planner App
The purpose of this app is to create a profile for users to plan their next
vacation destination.  Users can add, edit, create, and delete destinations and
track the places they have travelled for future use within the app.

## Version 2 goals & wishes
What I would like to add in version 2 would be a working calendar where users
 could see their dates of travel.  I would also like each user to have destinations
  shared with them via data tracking capabilities.
